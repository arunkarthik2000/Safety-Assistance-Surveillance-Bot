Developed a Safety Assistance Surveillance Bot designed to provide real-time environmental awareness using an ultrasonic sensor-based 3D mapper and a mounted mobile camera for live video feed. The bot enables remote surveillance by integrating a JavaScript-powered web interface that connects the PC to a server, facilitating seamless bot movement control. The video stream is processed and displayed in a web browser, allowing users to monitor surroundings with precision.
